# Red_Bus_Application
This Project Focuses on Data Scraping Using Selenium, Data Engineering using Pandas library, Connect to MySQL Database to store the extracted Data and Create an interactive Web Application using Streamlit.

Project Deliverables:

  1.Source Code: Python scripts for data scraping, SQL database interaction, and Streamlit application.
  
  2.Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the code, data collection, and application usage.
  
  3.Database Schema: SQL scripts to create and populate the database.
  
  4.Application using Streamlit : Screenshots or links to the Streamlit application showing data filtering/ analysis.

Files Attached: Attached 4 codes(3 .ipynb files and 1 .py file) and 4 Documents as Code Explanation Documentation :

  A.Red_Bus_Scrapping.ipynb - This file has the code for scrapping all the data given in the problem statement for 10 Transports.
  
  B.RedBus_Data_Cleaning_WBTC.ipynb - This file has the code to clean one transport data and the same code is used for all other 10 Transports.
  
  C.SQL_Connection.ipynb - This file has the code to connect to MySQL database, create a table and insert the scrapped data.
  
  D.redbus.py - This file has the code to create an interactive user friendly web based Streamlit application.
  
  E.Code Explanation Docs are also included for all the 4 Source code in the  format.
  
  F.FINAL_BUSES.csv - This is a CSV File of all the data scraped, cleaned and concatenated together before populating the SQL database.
  
Results:
  - Successfully scraped  10 Government State Bus Transport data from Redbus website using Selenium. Also included the private bus information for the selected routes.
    
  - Stored the data in a structured SQL database.
   
  - Developed an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering and analysis.
    
  - Ensured that the application is user-friendly and efficient.
